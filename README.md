# redis_pool

## Synopsis

  minimalistic [redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) client for erlang.
  
  Derived from:
  
   - https://github.com/bmizerany/redis-erl/
   - https://github.com/JacobVorreuter/redis_pool/

## Overview

  redis_pool is a redis client implementation that only
  uses redis's [multi bulk command protocol](http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/ProtocolSpecification).
  
  It implements connection pools, timeout management, automatic reconnect
  on errors and a very simple sharding mechanism.

## Raw examples

    0> redis_pool:start_link().  % connect to default redis port on localhost
    {ok,<0.33.0>}
    1> redis_pool:expand_pool(10).
    ok
    2> redis:q(["set", "foo", "bar"]).
    {ok,<<"OK">>}
    3> redis:q(["get", "foo"]).
    {ok,<<"bar">>}
    4> redis:q(["sadd", "bar", "a"]).
    {ok,1}
    5> redis:q(["sadd", "bar", "b"]).
    {ok,1}
    6> redis:q(["sadd", "bar", "c"]).
    {ok,1}
    7> redis:q(["lrange", "0", "-1"]).
    {error,<<"ERR wrong number of arguments for 'lrange' command">>}
    7> redis:q(["lrange", "bar", "0", "-1"]).
    {error,<<"ERR Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value">>}
    8> redis:q(["smembers", "bar"]).
    [{ok,<<"c">>},{ok,<<"a">>},{ok,<<"b">>}]
    9> redis:q(["incr", "counter"]).
    {ok,1}

## Multiple Pools

    1> redis_pool:start_link(one).
    {ok,<0.33.0>}
    2> redis_pool:start_link(two).
    {ok,<0.36.0>}
    3> redis_pool:start_link(three).
    {ok,<0.39.0>}
    4> redis_pool:start_link(four). 
    {ok,<0.42.0>}
    5> redis_pool:expand(one, 10).
    ok
    6> redis_pool:expand(two, 10).
    ok
    7> redis_pool:expand(three, 10).
    ok
    8> redis_pool:expand(four, 10). 
    ok
    9> redis_shard:start_link(shard, [one, two, three, four]).
    {ok,<0.91.0>}
    10> redis:q(redis_shard:pool(shard, "foo"), ["set", "foo", "bar"]).
    {ok, <<"OK">>}

## Multiple Pools with Manager

    1> redis_sup:start_link().
    {ok,<0.33.0>}
    2> redis_shard:start_link(main, []).
    {ok,<0.35.0>}
    3> redis_manager:start_link(main, [{one, [10]}, {two, [10]}, {three, [10]}, {four, [10]}]).
    {ok,<0.37.0>}
    4> redis:q(redis_shard:pool(main, "foo"), ["set", "foo", "bar"]).
    {ok,<<"OK">>}

## Breakdance/Breakdown

    redis_pool:start_link() -> ok | {error, Reason}
    redis_pool:start_link(Name) -> ok | {error, Reason}
    redis_pool:start_link(Name, Opts) -> ok | {error, Reason}
    redis_pool:start_link(Name, Opts, MaxRestarts, Interval) -> ok | {error, Reason}
    
      Types:
        
        Name = atom()
        MaxRestarts = Interval = number()
        Options = [Opt]
        Opt = {atom(), Value}
        Value = term()

      Connects to redis server

      The available options are:

      {ip, Ip}

        If the host has several network interfaces, this option
        specifies which one to use.  Default is "127.0.0.1".

      {port, Port}

        Specify which local port number to use.  Default is 6379.

      {pass, Pass}

        Specify to password to auth with upon a successful connect.
        Default is <<>>.

      {db, DbIndex}

        Sepcify the db to use.  Default is 0.

      Name represents the name of the pool you are creating, by default
      it's redis_pool.
      
      MaxRestarts and Interval stop the restart cycle when the
      connections in the pool die too often, where often is defined as
      MaxRestarts in Interval.

    redis_pool:expand(NewSize) -> ok
    redis_pool:expand(Name, NewSize) -> ok

      Types:
      
        NewSize = number()
        
          Set the connection pool to the given size.
        
        Name = atom()

          Send the call to a specific pool. By default redis_pool.

    redis_pool:pool_size() -> number()
    redis_pool:pool_size(Name) -> number()
    
      Types
      
        Name = atom()
      
      Returns the current number of live connections in the pool.

    redis_pool:pid() -> pid() | {error, term()}
    redis_pool:pid(Name) -> pid() | {error, term()}
    
      Types
      
        Name = atom()
    
      Return a connection from the specified pool or from the default one.
    
    redis_pool:cycle(NewOpts) -> ok
    redis_pool:cycle(Name, NewOpts) -> ok
    
      Types
      
        NewOpts = [NewOpt]
        NewOpt = {atom(), Value}
        Value = term()
        Name = atom()
    
      Recreate every connection in the pool using the provided NewOpts.
      NewOpts follows the same rules as in redis_pool:start_link/4.
      
      Name specifies the name of the connection pool or redis_pool if not
      provided.
    
    redis_pool:info() -> term()
    redis_pool:info(Name) -> term()
    
      Types
      
        Name = atom()

      Returns the current state of the connection pool.
    
    redis_shard:start_link(Servers) -> ok | {error, Reason}
    redis_shard:start_link(Name, Servers) -> ok | {error, Reason}
    
      Types
      
        Servers = [Server]
        Server = term()
        Name = atom()

        Starts a shard manager that splits evenly an md5 interval
        across the given terms in order.
        
        The suggested way of using this is by having each Server be the
        name of a connection pool. But you can also store additional
        information. You'll however need to extract the label to the
        connection pool in order to access it.
    
    redis_shard:pool(Key) -> atom() | {error, Reason}
    redis_shard:pool(Name, Key) -> atom() | {error, Reason}
    
      Types
      
        Key = number() | list()
        Name = atom()
        
        Returns from the given shard the label that contains the
        specified key or index.
    
    redis_shard:update_shards(Servers) -> ok
    redis_shard:update_shards(Name, Servers) -> ok
    
      Types
      
        Servers = [Server]
        Server = term()
        Name = atom()
    
      Updates the initial configuration and redistributes the shards to
      new servers. No consistency checks are done at this point.

    redis:q(Parts) -> {ok, binary()} | {ok, int()} | {error, binary()}
    redis:q(Name, Parts) -> {ok, binary()} | {ok, int()} | {error, binary()}
    redis:q(Name, Parts, Timeout) -> {ok, binary()} | {ok, int()} | {error, binary()}

      Types

        Parts = [Part]

          The sections, in order, of the command to be executed

        Part = binary() | list()

          A section of a redis command

      Tell redis to execute a command.
      
        Name = atom()
        
          Execute a command in a specific pool of connections
        
        Timeout = number()
        
          Specify a timeout in ms after which the call can be considered
          failed and the connection can be recycled.
